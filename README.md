# Presentations:
## Stunt Doubles For Your Code
[Stunt Doubles For Your Code Slides](/Stunt Doubles For Your Code.pdf)
You probably know them as mocks and stubs, but these are only two of a category known as Test Doubles. Test Doubles are like stunt doubles for your code - they stand in for code you wish to isolate from the unit you are testing and perform the required actions. In this session you will learn about Test Stubs, Test Spies, Mock Objects, Fake Objects, and Dummy Objects. You will learn how to use them, when to use them, and the type of situations you would want to use each of them. Return to your office and take your unit tests to the next level with these advanced techniques.

Target Audience: This talk is aimed at developers who work in environments having little to no code coverage with unit tests.  
Description: Developers are more confident making changes to code when it is covered by tests. Tests can be run as part of a business' deployment process improving overall quality. When starting a new "green field" project, this can be accomplished using Test Driven Development (TDD) which prescribes writing tests and then writing code to make those tests pass. But what if we already have a code base written with little or no tests? How do we improve our code coverage then? In this talk I will show you how to install TestBox quickly in your existing environment and how to get started writing tests improving the quality of your code and the dependability of your application. You will learn what tests to write, how to name them, how to write them, and when to write them. Attendees will be able to return to their office and immediately begin writing tests covering their legacy code, improving quality and reliability of their application.
